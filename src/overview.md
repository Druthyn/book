# Ecosystem Overview

As it stands there are two approaches for using Rust on Espressif chips, `std` and `no_std`. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, so you should choose one based on your project's needs.

This chapter contains an overview of the two approaches followed by a brief comparison between them:

- [Using the Rust Standard Library (`std`)](./overview/using-the-standard-library.html)
- [Bare Metal (`no_std`)](./overview/bare-metal.html)
- [Comparing `std` and `no_std`](./overview/comparing-std-and-no_std.html)

The [esp-rs organization] on GitHub is home to a number of repositories related to running Rust on Espressif chips. Most of the required crates have their source code hosted here.
